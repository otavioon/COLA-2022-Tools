		   The Boffins have shown that if we obey (1) we converge

		   The correct factor f must be in Q30, as this is the fixed
		   point format required by the lms_adapt_bg() function,
		   therefore the scaled version of (1) is:

		   (2^30) * f  = (2^30) * Beta * clean_bg_rx/P

		   factor      = (2^30) * (2^-2) * clean_bg_rx/P

		   (30 - 2 - log2(P))
		   factor      = clean_bg_rx 2                     ----- (3)

		   To avoid a divide we approximate log2(P) as top_bit(P),
		   which returns the position of the highest non-zero bit in
		   P.  This approximation introduces an error as large as a
		   factor of 2, but the algorithm seems to handle it OK.

		   Come to think of it a divide may not be a big deal on a
		   modern DSP, so its probably worth checking out the cycles
		   for a divide versus a top_bit() implementation.
