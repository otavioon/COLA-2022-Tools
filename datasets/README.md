# Datasets directory

## Overview

This directory contains the datasets. 
They are organized as follows.
- `src` directory contains the datasets' source code;
- `obj` directory contains the datasets' object code (generated by LLVM);
- `features` directory contains the features extracted from each dataset sample (*i.e.*, each application).

## `src` directory

The first subdirectory level indicates the problem: 
- `algo`: algorithm;
- `loop`: loop depth;
- `optz`: best optimization sequence.

The second level indicates the dataset name. 
- `poj`: applications extracted from the POJ (TODO: add description)


**TODO**:
- Finish describing the dataset names.
- Remove unnecessary datasets (algo:poj_test is necessary?)
- Explain why the set of applications at algo:poj differ the set of applications at optz:poj 
- Explain why the set of applications at loop:anghabench differ from the set of applications at optz:anghabench.

The following tree shows the dataset organization.
