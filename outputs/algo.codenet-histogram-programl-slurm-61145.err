WARNING:tensorflow:AutoGraph could not transform <bound method GraphConvolution.call of <stellargraph.layer.gcn.GraphConvolution object at 0x2b3ba3c20d90>> and will run it as-is.
Please report this to the TensorFlow team. When filing the bug, set the verbosity to 10 (on Linux, `export AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY=10`) and attach the full output.
Cause: module 'gast' has no attribute 'Index'
To silence this warning, decorate the function with @tf.autograph.experimental.do_not_convert
